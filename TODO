 - Conditionally load different structures based on previous values
 - Flesh out more example formats to see what other features are missing
 - Chunks containing other chunks
 - Additional field types, including 80-bit IEEE-754 floats
 - with blocks inside of class definitions to handle branching
 - Support for raw offsets, for both reading and writing
 - Loosen the coupling between structures, fields and field internals
 - Fix resolution of calculated values in the face of complex expressions
